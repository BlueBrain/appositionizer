Appositionizer
=============

Appositionizer looks through a list of cell morphologies that have been
positioned correctly in 3D, and detects where two cells are sufficiently
close to form a connection. On the pre-synaptic side, connections are then
placed such that the distance between successive connections falls into an
inter-bouton interval.

In addition to this User Guide we also provide a detailed `Developer Guide`_.
